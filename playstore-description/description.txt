This is a Live Wallpaper, that displays the current batterylevel in a fancy and stylish way.
I wanted it to play along the new clean style of Android Kitkat 4.4!
As this is displayed in the back of your homescreen, it won't cost "real estate" on your screen like for example a fancy widget.

There is a free and a paid version of this app. The paid version is basicly the same as the free version. Both versions are add-free! 
But the paid version will be updated more often. Will get new features, new styles and bugfixes faster than the free version!

Features:
- There are lots of styles to choose from.
- animation on charge 
- custom backgrounds (choose from gallery)
- background is sliding, wenn swiping through homescreen pages
- lots of settings to customize the battery
- ...like colors, opacity and so on...
- low battery-drain, as it is not really "live"
- no adds
- no internet connection

Rights explained:
- "android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"
- "android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"
READ for getting the custom background images
WRITE for debug purposes...(if you switch on the debugging option) the generated Battery-Images are written to /sdcard/Pictures/<stylename>/*.png
